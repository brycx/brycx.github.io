title: "An audit of the Turtl core library"
date: 2021-05-02

Lately, I've spent some parts of my evenings poking at [Turtl's](https://turtlapp.com/) [core library](https://github.com/turtl/core-rs). Turtl is a note-taking application, focused on security and listed
as one of three recommended alternatives, on [privacytools.io](https://privacytools.io/software/notebooks/), to Evernote, Google Keep, or Microsoft OneNote.

I've collected the findings in a short audit report which can be found here: [audit report link](/files/turtl_audit_report.pdf).

The work was unpaid, focused primarily on crypto, and done mostly whenever I found the time for it, so it is in no way exhaustive of the entire library.

I'd like to thank Andrew Lyon([@orthecreedence](https://github.com/orthecreedence)) for being very helpful in collaboration and answering questions.
